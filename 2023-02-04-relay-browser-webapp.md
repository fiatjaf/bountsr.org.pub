A very simple and lean web Nostr client dedicated only to browsing relays. Should have a nice, fast, usable UX.

Without any public key, the user should be able to see the "global feed" in every relay and compare them. Perhaps using a tabbed view or a side-by-side view of multiple relays.

With a public key the user should be able to see their own posts (or the posts of whoever owns that public key) and also a view of their "home feed", i.e. the posts of those whom they follow. Again, these views should be comparable between relays.

Other ideas that could be left for a second iteration:
  - if the user logs in using a NIP-07 extension they should be able to
    - delete posts from one relay individually
    - or copy posts individually from one relay to the other
    - posts could be clickable, but this involves making this more into a full-featured client

The specs above are just ideas to serve as inspiration. Let me know how they could be improved.

The bounty size can be increased depending on how this is going.

Please reach out to me before starting to work on this.
